# Skill: Future Phase Readiness

## Purpose

Use this skill when making Phase 1 design decisions that may affect future phases.

Phase 1 must stay read-only, but the system should be clean and extensible.

## Possible Future Features

Future phases may include:

- AI remediation suggestions.
- Incident ticket creation.
- Approval-based remediation.
- CI/CD pipeline trigger.
- Rollback workflow.
- n8n workflow orchestration.
- Incident history database.
- Kubernetes resource changes.

These are not Phase 1 features.

## Design Current APIs for Future Tools

Metrics Service APIs should be stable and easy for future tools like n8n to call.

Recommended API qualities:

- Predictable endpoint names.
- Structured JSON responses.
- Clear error shapes.
- Explicit time range parameters.
- Validated namespace and service parameters.
- Consistent status fields.
- No hidden dependency on Claude-specific behavior.

## Keep Phase 1 Clean

Do not add placeholder remediation code, disabled write routes, or unused orchestration layers in Phase 1.

Instead:

- Keep metric retrieval separate from AI interpretation.
- Keep Teams delivery separate from metric retrieval.
- Keep future workflow integrations behind stable API contracts.
- Document what future phases may add.

## Future n8n Integration

n8n can be added later as an orchestration layer for:

- Scheduled workflows.
- Approval flows.
- Incident ticket creation.
- Notifications.
- Human-in-the-loop remediation.
- Cross-system automation.

To prepare:

- Keep read-only metrics APIs documented.
- Keep response schemas stable.
- Use authentication and access control consistently.
- Avoid coupling business logic to a single chat interface.

## Phase 1 Boundary

Even when preparing for future phases, do not implement:

- Write APIs.
- Remediation tools.
- Pipeline triggers.
- Rollback actions.
- Kubernetes mutation actions.

Future readiness means clean boundaries, not premature automation.
